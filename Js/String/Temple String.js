const name = 'Anderson';
const Email = 'ander7@gmail.com';

const msg = 'The Name Is ' + name + 'For Contact ' + Email;
console.log(msg) // It's more confusable and stuff to concatinate instead of this we can use ->

console.log(`The name is ${name} for contact ${Email}`)

// $name defines the expression .

// we say template but it's not template, its already a string

//to know easy simple it is an example like IIFE . and IIFE works when we involed. so same thing  happens with string it is immediately goes and construct.
